# Image_to_BRAM_through_UART
This is about how to transfer the image of 28x28 size to FPGA through UART serial port. The transferred image will be stored in a BRAM.

Detailed explanation about the UART on FPGA can be found [here](https://github.com/avdssrk/UART_Virtex6).

The output of the CMD after transmitting one complete image is shown below.
